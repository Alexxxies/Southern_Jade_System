Numerous insurance companies in the country continue to utilize a manual approach in their operations to this day. 
However, they have encountered challenges in maintaining their systems, such as delayed transactions, duplicate data, and insecure files. 
To address these problems, researchers have created a universal information system that will be implemented by businesses across the entire South Luzon region.
In response to these issues, researchers have developed a generic information system to support businesses in the region, aiming to streamline tasks and provide accurate data.
The proposed system aims to provide a precise, fast, and user-friendly approach for completing company transactions. 
It addresses issues with the current system and offers benefits such as generating timely documents and reports, integrating data from multiple files, 
minimizing errors, and ensuring quick data retrieval with high accuracy and integrity.
